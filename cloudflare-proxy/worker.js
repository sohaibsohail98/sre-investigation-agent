/**
 * Minimal reverse proxy: forwards every request to env.ORIGIN (the real
 * Cloud Run service URL) unchanged, and streams the response straight
 * back (response.body is already a ReadableStream, so this works for
 * the /api/chat SSE endpoint too, not just plain JSON/HTML). Gives this
 * service a short *.workers.dev URL without moving it off Cloud Run.
 *
 * See docs/DEPLOYMENT.md for the deploy command.
 *
 * Identical (proxy logic, not config) to mcp-context-inspector's own
 * cloudflare-proxy/worker.js, which fronts the inspector's Cloud Run
 * service the same way — not shared across repos on purpose (each is
 * independently deployable), but fix bugs in both copies.
